# betting-system
This is the smart contract and frontend for the betting system for the VEX project. It runs on the testnet and has no DAO, oracle or FT associated with it.

<br />

# Quickstart

1. Make sure you have installed [rust](https://rust.org/). (<1.70)
2. Install the [`NEAR CLI`](https://github.com/near/near-cli#setup)

<br />

## 1. Start the contract
By running the below code the contract will be compiled, deployed and then the frontend launched.

```bash
chmod +x magic.sh
./magic.sh
```

<br />

## 2. Interact with the contract via the frontend
When not signed in, one can only view the current matches. Once the user signs in with a wallet then they can choose to bet on a match by selecting a team and an amount in NEAR to bet.

## 3. Interact with the contract via the CLI 

Check the dev account the contract is deployed on
```bash
cat ./contract/neardev/dev-account
# e.g. dev-1659899566943-21539992274727
```

The contract can be used via the CLI with the following commands: 

```bash
near call <dev account name> create_match '{"team_1": " ", "team_2": " ", "in_odds_1": " ", "in_odds_2": " ", "date": " "}' --accountId <dev account name>
near call <dev account name> end_betting '{"match_id": " "}' --accountId <dev account name>
near call <dev account name> finish_match '{"match_id": " ", "winning_team": " "}' --accountId <dev account name>
near call <dev account name> return_funds '{"match_id": " ", "state": " "}' --accountId <dev account name>
near call <dev account name> make_bet '{"match_id": " ", "decision": " "}' --amount 2 --accountId <your account name>
near view <dev account name> view_matches '{"match_id": " "}'
near view <dev account name> view_bets '{"match_id": " ", "name": " "}'
near view <dev account name> view_potential_winnings '{"match_id": " ", "team": " ", "bet_amount": " "}'
```
